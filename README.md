# Ticketmaster

This project utilizes Python to interact with Ticketmaster's services. To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Run the Python script to execute the main application:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

Make sure you have Yarn and Python3 installed on your system before running the commands. This set of commands assumes a Unix-like shell environment. Adjust accordingly if you are using a different operating system or shell.

Feel free to explore and customize the code to suit your needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the documentation or seek support from the project's community.
